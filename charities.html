        <h2>Major Food Charities</h2>
        <p>
            A number of national charities work tirelessly to address food poverty and
            hunger across the UK. They not only provide meals and food parcels but
            also campaign for systemic change. Below is an overview of some of the
            main organisations and what they do.
        </p>
        <section class="charity">
            <h3>The Trussell Trust</h3>
            <p>
                The Trussell Trust supports a nationwide network of over 1,200 food bank
                centres. Its vision is for a future where no one in the UK needs a
                food bank. The Trust provides nutritionally balanced emergency food and
                support to people facing crises and campaigns to end the need for food
                banks entirely【139774249184268†L42-L56】. Between April and September&nbsp;2021
                the network distributed around 5,100 emergency food parcels every day【139774249184268†L58-L61】.

            <h3>FareShare</h3>
            <p>
                FareShare tackles both food waste and hunger. Millions of tonnes of
                perfectly edible food are wasted by the UK food industry every year. At
                the same time, millions of people struggle to afford to eat. FareShare
                addresses these issues by redistributing surplus food that would
                otherwise go to waste to frontline organisations supporting people
                facing hunger【56581690013979†L169-L174】. The charity notes that around 11&nbsp;million
                people in the UK are struggling to get enough to eat【56581690013979†L182-L199】, and
                there are over 4&nbsp;million tonnes of good‑to‑eat food wasted each year
                — enough for an estimated 10&nbsp;billion meals【56581690013979†L190-L197】.

            <h3>Magic Breakfast</h3>
            <p>
                Magic Breakfast works with schools across England and Scotland to
                ensure that no child starts the day too hungry to learn. The charity
                provides more than 300,000 breakfasts every school day and offers
                expert advice to tackle morning hunger【130247994050415†L278-L283】. It runs
                research‑led programmes demonstrating that school breakfasts improve
                pupils’ mental wellbeing and educational attainment【130247994050415†L343-L359】.

            <h3>The Felix Project</h3>
            <p>
                The Felix Project is London’s largest food redistribution charity. It
                rescues high‑quality surplus food that would otherwise go to waste and
                redistributes it to over 1,200 community organisations across the
                capital【732076860572306†L45-L50】. The charity runs initiatives like Felix’s Kitchen
                and Multibank to provide meals and household essentials to families in
                need, and it works with volunteers and partners across the city to
                fight food waste and hunger【732076860572306†L45-L52】.
